0,Float On,Good News for People Who Love Bad News,"Float On Lyrics[Verse 1]
I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay
[Chorus]
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

[Verse 2]
A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
Bring it on, here we are, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, win or lose, win or lose
Win or lose, win or lose, I can't say

[Chorus]
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright

Already, we'll all float on
No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on

[Bridge]
(Alright, already) And we'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on
Alright, already, we'll all float on [I'm told ""don't function"" and listen everyday]
Alright, already, we'll all float on [The worlds' still going strong]
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on [I lose hair]
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on [while living here]
Alright, already, we'll all float on (Alright!) [float on]
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on (Alright!)

1,3rd Planet,The Moon & Antarctica,"3rd Planet Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

[Verse 2]
My boss just quit the job
Says he's going out to find blind spots
And he'll do it

[Verse 3]
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand
[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

[Refrain]
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then; was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

[Bridge]
Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood

2,The World at Large,Good News for People Who Love Bad News,"The World at Large Lyrics[Verse 1]
Ice age heat wave, can't complain
If the world's at large, why should I remain?
Walked away to another plan
Gonna find another place, maybe one I can stand
I move on to another day
To a whole new town with a whole new way
Went to the porch to have a thought
Got to the door, and again, I couldn't stop
You don't know where and you don't know when
But you've still got your words and you've got your friends
Walk along to another day
Work a little harder, work another way
Well uh-uh, baby, I ain't got no plan
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
Gonna float on, maybe would you understand?
Well I float on, maybe would you understand?
[Verse 2]
The days get shorter and the nights get cold
I like the autumn but this place is getting old
I pack up my belongings and I head for the coast
It might not be a lot, but I feel like I'm making the most
The days get longer and the nights smell green
I guess it's not surprising, but it's spring and I should leave
I like songs about drifters, books about the same
They both seem to make me feel a little less insane
Walked on off to another spot
I still haven't gotten anywhere that I want
Did I want love? Did I need to know?
Why does it always feel like I'm caught in an undertow?

[Verse 3]
The moths beat themselves to death against the lights
Adding their breeze to the summer nights
Outside, water, like air, was gray
I didn't know what I had that day
Walk a little farther to another plan
You said that you did, but you didn't understand
I know that starting over's not what life's about
But my thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud I couldn't hear my mouth
My thoughts were so loud30Embed"

Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

[Verse 2]
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything17Embed"

But God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

Well, we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, ""Sacrifice the liver!""

So tell me now why, you'll tell me never

Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
[Bridge 1]
Well, see what you want to see
You should see it all
Well, take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well, I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go

[Verse 3]
If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty
Well, my problem is I can't see
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well, who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?
[Verse 4]
Well, all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

[Verse 5]
I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski

But God who'd wanna be

Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything

And I shout that you're all fakes (Fakes)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you

Ha, that boy fell down on his harelip—Oh, oh
Well I, I might be wrong
But you, you tag along

Bring your candy taster, time wasters around
And we'll fuck with their minds

With his shirttails wrinkled, hanging out

Oh, it could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield was broken
But I love the fresh air you know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know, oh!
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing
Which was more than I wanted you to know-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!
Oh! It would've been, could've been
Worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks
But I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh if the world don't like us
It'll shake us just like we were a co-oh-oh-oh-old
Now here we go!

[Chorus]
Well we scheme and we scheme but would always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well tow it
Standing at a light switch to each East and West horizon
Every dawn one yells ""Surprise""
And in the evening one's consoling
Saying ""See it wasn't quite as bad as""

[Bridge]
Well, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh-oh-oh. oh-oh-oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show
[Verse]
Yeah, it would've been, could've been
Worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)
Hard-wired to conceive, so much we had to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, we could've been, should've been
Worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well it sounds like the place I'd like to go-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now here we go!

Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it

15,Bankrupt on Selling,The Lonesome Crowded West,"Bankrupt on Selling LyricsWell all the Apostles, they're sitting in swings
Saying, ""I'd sell off my Savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps
That cling best to the era""
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash
To each other, but they're sick of it all
And they're bankrupt on selling

And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all, seen through 'em all
Seen through most everything
All the people you knew were the actors
All the people you knew were the actors
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words
He must've learned in college
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
I come clean out of love with my lover
I still love her, loved her more
When she used to be sober and I was kinder9Embed"

Oh, gotta see, gotta know right now
What's that writing on your shelf
In the bathrooms and the bad motels?
No one really cared for it at all
Not the gravity plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Early, early in the morning
It pulls all on down my sore feet
I wanna go back to sleep
[Chorus]
In the motions and the things that you say
It all will fall, fall right into place
As fruit drops, flesh it sags
Everything will fall right into place
When we die, some sink and some lay
But at least I don't see you float away
And all the spilt milk, sex and weight
It all will fall, fall right into place

While we're on the subject
Could we change the subject now?
I was knocking on your ear's door
But you were always out
Looking towards the future
We were begging for the past
Well, we knew we had the good things
But those never seemed to last
Oh, please just last

[Verse 2]
Everyone's unhappy
Everyone's ashamed
Well, we all just got caught looking
At somebody else's page
Well, nothing ever went
Quite exactly as we planned
Our ideas held no water
But we used them like a dam
[Chorus]
Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell
Say, ""Yes, this is a fine promotion""
Oh, and I laugh all the way to Hell

[Verse 3]
Of course, everyone goes crazy
Over such and such and such
We made ourselves a pillar
We just used it as a crutch
We were certainly uncertain
At least, I'm pretty sure I am
Well, we didn't need the water
But we just built that good-God-dam

[Chorus 2]
Oh, and I know this of myself
I assume as much for other people
Oh, and I know this of myself
We've listened more to life's end-gong than
The sound of life's sweet bells

[Verse 4]
Was it ever worth it?
Was there all that much to gain?
Well, we knew we'd missed the boat
And we'd already missed the plane
We didn't read the invite
We just danced at our own wake
All our favorites were a-playing
So we could shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
[Verse 5]
Tiny curtain's open
And we heard the tiny clap of little hands
A tiny man would tell a little joke
And get a tiny laugh from all the folks
Sittin', driftin' around on bubbles, and
Thinkin' it was us that carried them
When we finally got it figured out
That we had truly missed the boat

[Chorus]
Oh, and we carried it all so well
As if we got a new position
Oh, and we owned all the tools ourselves
But not the skills to make a shelf with
Oh, what useless tools ourselves8Embed"

Well, all's not well but I'm told that it'll all be quite nice
You'll be drowned in boots like mafia
But your feet will still float like Christ's
Well, I'll be damned
They were right
I'm drowning upside down
My feet afloat like Christ's
I'm in heaven trying to figure out which stack
They're going to stuff us Atheists into
And Peter and his monkey laugh and I'll laugh with them
I'm not sure what at
They point and say:
""We'll keep you in the back,""
Polishing halos, baking manna and gas
[Verse 2]
Well, some guy comes in looking a bit like everyone I ever seen
He moves just like Crisco disco
Breathin' a hundred percent Listerine
He says looking at something else but directing everything to me
""Any time anyone gets on their knees to pray
Well, it makes my telephone ring"" and I'll be damned
He said, ""You were right, no one's running this whole thing""
He had a theory, too

He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself
And you of you
He said that God takes care of himself, God takes care of himself

Blame it on the Tetons
Yeah, I need a scapegoat now

[Verse 1]
No, my dog won't bite you
Though it had the right to
You ought to give her credit
'Cause she knows I would've let it happen

[Chorus]
Blame it on the weekends
God, I need a cola now

[Verse 2]
Oh, we mumble loudly
Wear our shame so proudly
Wore our blank expressions
Trying to look interesting
[Chorus]
Blame it all on me 'cause
God, I need a cold one now

[Bridge]
All them eager actors
Gladly take the credit
For the lines created
By the people tucked away from–
Sight–
Is just a window
From the room we're bound to
If you find a way out
Oh, would you just let me know how?
Would you just let me know how?

[Chorus]
Blame it on the web, but the
Spider's your problem now

[Verse 3]
Language is the liquid
That we're all dissolved in
Great for solving problems
After it creates a problem

Blame it on the Tetons
God, I need a scapegoat now

[Outro]
Everyone's a building burning
With no one to put the fire out
Standing at the window looking out
Waiting for time to burn us down
Everyone's an ocean drowning
With no one really to show how
They might get a little better air
If they turned themselves into a cloud12Embed"
31,Ansel,Strangers to Ourselves,"Ansel Lyrics[Intro]
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
I took a trip down to Mexico
With my father and brother, Ansel
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Was I really supposed to know?
How the hell would I know?
There it goes!

[Verse 2]
I made a mess of myself and the trip on the whole
My father stayed patient with me; why? I don't know
You can't know, you can't ever really know
That's the last time I'd see my brother, Ansel
There it goes, so!
[Refrain]
Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds
Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds

[Verse 3]
Me and my sister we hung on the phone
Watching the news as they looked for Ansel
On top of that mountain, underneath the snow
Their dogs were a-sniffin', I guess you never know
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?

[Interlude]
On gears around an uncaring sun
It doesn't know what it gave
As the bone moon winds 'round again
Again this allows one sphere's heart to pump
Pumping waves of hearts that come and go
And then come and then

[Verse 4]
You can't know, well, you won't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
No, you can't know
The last time that you'll ever see another soul
No, you never get to know
No, you don't know7Embed"
32,Parting of the Sensory,We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank,"Parting of the Sensory Lyrics[Verse 1]
There's no work in walking in to fuel the talk
I would grab my shoes, and then away I'd walk
Through all the stubborn beauty, I'd start at the dawn
Until the sun had fully stopped
Never walking away from
Just a way to pull apart
Dehydrate back into minerals
A lifelong walk to the
Same exact spot

[Chorus]
Carbon's anniversary
The parting of the sensory
Old, old mystery
The parting of the sensory
[Verse 2]
Who the hell made you the boss?
We placed our chips in all the right spots
But still lost
Any shithead who had ever walked
Could take the ship and do a much finer job
These fit like clothes made out of wasps
Aw, fuck it, I guess I lost

[Chorus]
The parting of the sensory
Carbon's anniversary
Just part it again if you please
Carbon's anniversary

[Verse 3]
Who the hell made you the boss?
If you say what to do, I know when not to stop
If you were the ship, who would ever get on?
The weather changed it for the worse
And came down on us like it had been rehearsed
Unlikely hope, but change will surely come
It'd be awful for most, but really good for some
I took a trip to the exact same spot
We pulled the trigger, but we forgot to cock
And every single shot...
Aw, fuck it, I guess we lost

Then we'd know just where to go

Now let it drop
Let it all drop

Oh, let it all fall off

[Verse 1]
Well you were talking soda pop
You talked it quite a lot
The opinions that I do not give
The opinions I ain't got

So let it drop

Oh, let it all fall off

[Verse 2]
My ears were pressing firmly
Right against your mouth to hear
When you tried to spit the venom out
Your words were not so clear
Now drop

Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for fucked up history
Hold on to what you need
We've got a knack for messed up history
Well, we went downtown
And we sat in the rain
Well, look in one direction and wait for a train
Thought over, it's all over

I didn't know you kept track
I didn't know there was a score
But it looks like you're the winner; I ain't gonna play no more
It's over, game over

Well, we walked real stiff and our canes tapped the ground
You hit me with yours
And said ""Pull yourself together""
It's over, oh, it's over

You can say what you want but don't act like you care
It takes more than one person
To decide what's fair
It's over, think it over

[Pre-Chorus]
You were spitting venom
At most everyone you know
If the damned gave you a road map
Then you'd know just where to go
[Verse 3]
So we carried all the groceries in
While hauling out the trash
And if this doesn't make us motionless
I do not know what can

So to say
What a rotten thing to say, such an awful thing to say
I didn't mean to bite you, sorry
What always did, what always did
What always had to sling

[Chorus]
So let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

Let it drop
Let it all drop
Let it all drop
Oh, let it all fall off

As soon as you paint every last grain of sand
As you soon as you paint every star
In the sky, sky, sky, sky, sky, sky
Wave goodbye, sugar boats!
Well, I’m swatting at mosquitoes as they’re orbiting me
I'm orbiting the sun and this goes on and on and on, you see
This heart of mine is just some broke machine
And when it gets a-goin', and it often gets a-goin'
It starts blowin' steam
Here we go again!
This rock of ours is just some big mistake
And we will never know just where we go
Or where we have came from
This watch of mine is like some sort of void
Cause when I look in, and I shouldn't look in
I, I see it swallow my time
Oh no, there it goes!

Well, I ain’t getting on no fast plane
Hell, I ain’t getting on no stuffy train
Sugar boats on the Atlantic are fine
The sugar boats, they're just fine
I'll stand on the deck so you could see
I'll stand on the deck you could wave bye, bye, bye, bye
Here's the ghost that goes and waves bye, bye, bye, bye
I'm the ghost that goes and waves bye, bye, bye3Embed"

Filling every single corner with our soft little gifts of ourselves
Getting carried, so, so carried away

From day to day, to day to day to today
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, and be brave
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, and be brave

Every head of bronze
At the Parthenon
Another monster hiding inside of a cave
We go from day to day misbehaving in the most appropriate ways
The unicorns missing last call to get on Noah's ship
We don't quit, we won't quit, we can't quit, we just don't quit

Well the Earth doesn't care and we hardly even matter
We're just a bit more piss to push out its full bladder
And as our bodies break down into all their rocky little bits
Piled up under mountains of dirt and silt
And still, the world, it don't give a shit

But be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave! (Be brave!)
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave! (Be brave!)

Now they'll receive their reward

In an hour or so later

Well, I'm fed up and I need to go
Out of existence or just down the road forever
Well, later that night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better
Well, a guy shows up, he's 25 years old
Always thought this kid was such a mama's boy!
He said, and that's what he said
He's been in the army and he did some speed
He went down to Thailand, and he did the deed
Oh yeah, he did it for the boys
A cop shows up, way damn late
I was excited, but usually I hate to see them

On the road, out of road

Said a bowlegged or maybe you're just peg-legged
Or something like that

Well, later at night on the side of the road
I'm out of gas and I should have known better, oh yeah
Cop showed up, way damn late
I was excited but usually I hate to see them, yeah

[Verse 4]
Big car, and I should’ve promised myself
I can not go when there’s nothing better
And it’s better all alone on the side of the road
I could’ve sworn she left when I was drunk
My God, now her face is gone
It goes on and on and on and on
Out of gas and nothing left
Got caught but I’m still on the gas
I said, I said, I said now I’m gonna break my pace3Embed"

What's up? Make love?

[Verse 1]
Ragweed tall, better hope that his ladder don't crack
Or he'll hit the ground low, hard and under his back
At the battle at the bottom of the ocean where the dead do rise
You need proof, I got proof at the surface
You can watch 'em float by

[Verse 2]
Way in back of the room, there sits a cage
Inside is the clock that you can win if you can guess its age
Which you never can do 'cause the time, it constantly changes
For lack or luck, I guess that is the saying
[Outro]
On the first page of the Book of Blue, it read
""If you read this page, then that'll be your death""
By then it was too late, and you wound up on
An island of shells and bones that bodies had left
And the one thing you taught me 'bout human beings was this
They ain't made of nothin' but water and shit

Its shell was covered in jewels and had been since time began
It knew the world through all its histories
And the universe and its mysteries

Oh, the man killed the tortoise, took his shell
And, with a song on his lips, walked off again

Pack a lunch, wander 'round
Toss the map on the ground
It is inaccurate anyways

We sneak out, drip by drip
Through paper cuts on our hands
Day after day, nothing's quite the same
We are tourists in our own heads

He don't remember, how it got there
It had a number, written on his forearm
It spelled disaster

[Verse 2]
He entered the club scene
All hoping, all hoping for dancing
He was looking, and looking stunning
His clothes reflected light, all right
She sat, she sat in the backseat
The car was plush but had no heat
And no, not no one was blushing
Their technique was so damn right
All right, and!
He read the note in the black light
He thought he read minds and was not right
That line still made him seem charming
His clothes were shining, shining2Embed"

It was second class but what's to lose?
And looking out her window she could more than assume
That you can't see air or time

She's the only rocketeer in the whole damn place
They gave her a mirror so she could talk to a face
She still got plenty lonely but that's just the case
With time, time, time

Started hearing voices sometime in June
She knew she could go crazy but didn't think that soon
Now she doesn't feel lonely but she'd just as soon
Try, try, try, try

93,Wooden Soldiers,The Golden Casket,"Wooden Soldiers Lyrics[Verse 1: Isaac Brock]
Making plans in the sands as the tides roll in
Didn't plan it, didn't plan it
Different planets stare down on us
Never blinking, sort of winking, indifferent as a ceiling
Observing that we're kneeling in the sands building plans
Making plans in the sand as the tides roll in
I've been sitting in the stove 'cause outside, it's sure been cold
The garbage can's refrigerated since that's where the food goes
Making plans, making plans, making plans

[Verse 2: Isaac Brock]
Wooden soldiers storm through burning buildings, on the top floor
Lives the zoo kings' neckties, prеventing them from breathing
Oh, it's such a fuzzy feeling, oh, it's such a fuzzy feeling making plans
Gasolinе flows out the ends of matchsticks used as pens
And I've been writing some pretty big checks with them
I gave the boat a person's name, so when it sinks, I'll know who to blame
The tiger isn't tame, but it's toothless just the same
[Chorus: Isaac Brock]
Making plans in the sands as the tides roll in
Making plans, making plans, making plans
Making plans in the sands as the tides roll in
Making plans

[Verse 3: Isaac Brock, Isaac Brock & Lisa Molinaro]
These fuckers wanted guilt, they tore me down and I rebuilt
Much better, oh, much better than before
In India, they make mugs, you throw them down, they turn to mud
Pull it out and make them as they were before
Since we shop at the same store, but hate each other at the core
And neither one is getting a fair deal
Sell it all on sex appeal, how you currently feel
Don't need any, just buy one, the second one will be a steal
Hashtaggin', photo-braggin', no one's even sort of real
No wonder no one feels better than before

[Chorus: Isaac Brock & Lisa Molinaro]
Making plans in the sands as the tides roll in

Making plans in the sands as the tides roll in

And you were walking sideways too

So not a single one of us will ever leave town, here we go sir

Relax your breath, lean into yourself
Here's what I know is true
Well, the sun hasn't left, the sea still has depth
The rain's still wet, try not to forget
We're not so bereft, so here's a bell that still rings true
There's still something left, there's still something left for you

You're not wrong, things are a mess
But there's still something left
Friendships are just a chain of texts
But there's much more than this

You and I are us, you see

Lean into your breath and just help yourself, well, here's what I know is true
Well, there's more to life than online dating sites
Or hell, you pick the vice, I know that's not concise
There's still so much, so much here left for you
'Cause cactus bloom, trees leaf and root
The world is a womb, it ain't just a room
Well, there's still something left, something left for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Not everything is going to be the best
But there's still something left
Despite the endless crush of crests
Well, there's still something else

Surf rock mess with no surf, just pine trees
Struck by being ashamed of your old space
Just wanting that mean heat
You bleached your hair and you pawned your skis

And said, ""Oh, what a drag! Oh, what a backwards scheme
'Cause here things go from gray to gray and back to gray again
And they get green and go to gray and go back to gray again""
So he said

Call it education
It was somewhere in between
You gave me some sound advice
But I wasn't listening
After we had capsized
I could tell you how you thought
Well, I'm not sure if I'd laid to rest
On the ceiling or the wall

[Verse 2]
Not quite conversation
It was somewhere in between
You said everything is taught
And I listened patiently
All this dog and pony
We're still monkeys the whole time
We could not help from flinging shit
In our modern suits and ties
[Verse 3]
Our instincts, they were cringing
About how we lived our lives
It didn't seem we'd lived enough
To even get to die
All these dense distractions
So beautifully complex
Well, I love life's surprises so much
I don't want to know what's up ahead

Stubborn shouted and said
""I don't do what you do""
I don't know, couldn't really hear
Hardly if you hardly care, and you don't
Stubborn beauty, stubborn beauty
Oh, very well

Hardly education
It was somewhere in between
Oh, I hit the roof but I had
Aimed for the ceiling

[Verse 5]
Hardly education
All them books I didn't read
They just sat there on my shelf
Looking much smarter than me
Good old Nostradamus
He knew the whole damn time
There'd always be an East from West
And someone in there fighting

It takes more time to make a fake, we night swam down in the lake
And washed the dirt off our intentions
Prattled on about bad inventions

I can't wait to see you go to school
I hate that this will happen, but I know that it will happen
Someone's gonna be cruel
I can't believe the stork didn't need a crane
One, then two, then three of you, I'm working to be better
So that you get to do the same
We counted dark spots on the moon
The stars were barely visible, I know that I should let you
Count them far from this city roof

That I just cannot seem to place

Staring out at nothing, while nothing at all
Blankly stares right back
And I hope there's still something left for you
I can't wait to see which paths you choose
So that you can see animals
Far away from the stupid city zoo

'Cause the sunshine spills out your mouth and eyes
And out all on the floor and I

Sparking imagination till the sparks just quit
And if this is fun, why am I so bored with it?

Don't try takin' us to task
You didn't buy a face, nope, just a mask
So happy Halloween!""

About your dreams involving me

How consistent
How can someone so consistently mess up as much as every instance?
How can someone inconsistent mess up so consistently?

Look right now I'm standing on my haunches

Or have you got feelings
Or can you breathe underwater?

He chose lifting ten times his weight
And natural body armor
And then on the day his mother gave
He came out as an insect

Are the opinions I don't got

I knew a man who went on and on
About how he knew a man who knew a man
Who knew a man who knew him once
You can keep digging down and down
Without even turning ‘round
Or finding hell you'll find you're digging up again

So I let them all go free

And when them tree drop leaves your feet collect their memories
I guess all us snakes find our tails pretty damn tasty

With the TV in the cellar

And I know that this is real life
And I am talking to the sofa in the soda machine
And they're giving up logic that I've never seen though

Won't you let me in on your secret?
In the cellar
You can just blame a fortune teller

Or you ever gave me

You wanna know the reason?
Oh, I don't know my friends

Look at our creation, oh

You want another way back home?

It was like this in 1874
It was like this when you were a child
It was like this when I was a whore, well
They were amassing troops on the back of the isles
They were saying these things; they were all in denial
They were talking 'bout their own front lip
It smelled like, it smelled like shit
And they, they were eating popcorn out of a dish
They were saying, ""I wish, I wish, I wish!""
I was buried there in 1999
I was left there; I left my old self behind
Still living but you know I'm not in denial
I said what I said, and I said this
""In 1918, things were better, when I was nothing but a sweater.""
Now I'm born again as another man
I'm living on this in this foreign land
I used to be Angora, Angora fleece
Living all sound and I'd eat in peace
And no one knew, and no one cared
And you didn't know what you wanted there
It's not what you were thinking
Living as a resurrection, breathed out the cinnamon
And I was not to be confused
And in 1882, they still sold it to those fucks
Things were going wrong from the beginning
And no one was losing and no one was winning
They just fucked each other up

And in 1999, I was in a park in Chicago
Aw, that was right
He was like a father and he knew what he was saying
And wait, I'm not talking 'bout this bullshit
And I went to talk to the, the Italian boys who hung out there
They said that they would rather see me dead
Or at least not kept
They broke my jaw and I was left to thaw
I walked away and I called my Mom
I said, ""Hell yeah! It sucked, yeah! I loved it!""
Break my jaw now
You bring on, you bring it on
You got your ring on your pretty little finger now
One thing you remembered
You were never even once being clever
And you were, were sleeping
You were sleeping when they're saying that there was a phone, yeah
Mistakes were made and I ended up in Florida
Things were not right, I didn't care though
(No matter) what you do, and what you become
Either way, you end up all dumb
That's all right with me now, that's all right with me now
Whether you want to see it

The troops, they were amassing on the porch
They wanted to be their own damn thorn
And in the court of (?) center
The things were better and no one's really tougher
You're talkin' loud, you're talkin' proud
You trumpin' now
Aw shit, well, you said then, what you meant then
What you did then was you wanted to have sex
You could not do, you could not do
You could not pull it out but you tried to
And you said, ""Well, I don't need-
I don't need to wear myself a bikini tonight,""
It brings me to the embarrassment
I was sitting on a raft with the pond sediment
And they said, ""Hell, yeah, oh hell, yeah!
You look naked as shit but you're drunk so you don't care!""
Well, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

Thirdly, even if- even if- well, pick your deity, whoever- came down from the heavens or wherever the hills- wherever the deity lives and shit themselves, and blessed us with the vast knowledge of ""Freebird.""

200,Broke (Live 2004),Baron Von Bullshit Rides Again,"Broke (Live 2004) Lyrics[Audience Claps]

[Verse 1]
Broke account
So I broke a sweat
I've bought some things
That I sort of regret about now

[Verse 2]
Broke my pace
And ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit
That it should be a crime

[Verse 3]
Broke a promise
Cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse
It should be bronze by now
[Verse 4]
Broke your glasses
But it broke the ice
You said that I was an asshole
And I paid the price

[Verse 5]
Broken hearts
Want broken necks
I've done some things
That I want to forget, but I can't

[Verse 4]
Broke my pace
And ran out of time
Sometimes I'm so full of shit
That it should be a crime

[Verse 5]
Broke a promise
Cause my car broke down
Such a classic excuse
It should be bronze by now

[Verse 6]
Broke up
And I'm relieved somehow
It's the end of the discussions
That just go round and round
[Bridge]
And round, and round, and round, and round
And round, and round it shouldn't have been anyway
No way, no way, no way, that's right
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh no
It was like everything was evidence of broken time

[Verse 7]
You're living on fancy wine
You'll drink that turpentine
You're starting conversations
You don't even know the topic

[Verse 1]
Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I got this thing that I consider my only art
Of fucking people over

[Verse 2]
My boss just quit the job
Says she's going out to find blind spots
And she'll do it

[Verse 3]
The third planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped
When you get to the promised land
You're gonna shake the eye's hand
[Chorus]
Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well, outside, naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflecting off the moon
And baby cum angels fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end
That's how the world began
That's how the world will end

[Audience Cheers]

[Refrain]
Well, a third had just been made
And we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then, was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

[Bridge]
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth
That's how the world began
That's how the world will end
And that's how the world began

[Verse 1]
I was in heaven
I was in hell
Believe in neither
But fear them as well
This one's a doctor
This one’s a lawyer
This one's a cash thief
Taking your money
Back in the Metro
Ride on a Greyhound
Drunk on the Amtrack
Please shut up
Another rider
He was a talker
Talking about TV
Please shut up
This one's a crazer
Daydreaming disaster
The origin of junk food
Rutting through garbage
Tasty but worthless
Dogs eat their own shit
We’re doing the cockroach, yeah
[Chorus]
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
Doin' the cockroach, yeah
Yeah

You shake your tongue
You vibrate my eardrums
You're saying words
But you know I ain't listening

Your face
Your lips
Your hips
Your eyes
They meet
You’re not hungry though

Spent 18 hours waiting stoned 'cause grace
I spent the same 18 hours in the same damn place
I'm on a road shaped like a figure 8
I'm going nowhere, but I'm guaranteed to be late

[Chorus]
You go out like a riptide
You know that ball has no sides
You're an angel with an amber halo
Black hair and the devil's pitchfork
Wind-up anger with the endless view of
The ground's colorful patchwork
How have you been?
How have you been?
How have you?
How have you?
[Verse 2]
I drove around for hours, I drove around for days
I drove around for months and years and never went no place
We're on a pass, we're on pass
I stopped for gas, but where could place be
To pay for gas to drive around
Around the Interstate 8

[Chorus]
You go out like a riptide
You know a ball has no sides
You're an angel with an amber halo
Black hair and the devil's pitchfork
Wind-up anger with the endless view of
The ground's colorful patchwork
How have you been?
How have you been?
How have you?
How have you?

Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing

[Chorus]
And I shout that you're all fakes (fakes, fakes!)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
[Post-Chorus]
But when you're fucked up, it's 'til I dissolve
But it sounds like a contradiction to me
And what if it was me?
I'd be fuckеd up, too, you see

I didn't say much of anything at all

And I'm sittin' outside my mud lake, waiting for the pack to take me away
